# Applied-Mechatronics
Software developed for EIEF01 Applied Mechatronics

The mission was to create a micro controller board from scratch along with software to be able to control the speed of a motor over serial communication. This repo contains both the PC and micro controller parts of the project. In addition there are a number of test files that I used for rapid debugging during the final exam. The contents are as follows. 

Files in repository:
[Mech1.c] Master code for micro controller
